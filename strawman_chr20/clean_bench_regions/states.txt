22	TP	FN	TP	Tier1	Second assembly just missed it
19	FN	TP	TP	Tier1	First assembly just missed it
19	TN	FP	TN	Tier1	Could be assembly error, so just difficult to find
14	FP	TN	TN	Tier1	Could be assembly error, so just difficult to find
8	FN,FP	TP	TP	Tier1	First assembly misassembled
3	TP	FN,FP	TP	Tier1	Second assembly misassembled
5	FN	FN	TP	Tier1	Other assemblies miss it (could be coverage)
33	TP	TP	FN	Tier2	Obviously a variant there, but different alignment loses it
14	TP	TP	TN	Tier2	Probably a variant there, could be overly sensitive to alignment
9	TP	TP	FP	Tier2	Variant is there, but alignment causes new variant to be there
8	TP	FP	TP	Tier2	Second assembly is adding something (possible collapsed het)
3	FP	TP	TP	Tier2	First assembly is adding something (possible collapsed het)
5	TP	TP	FN,FP	Tier2	Variant is there, maybe Truvari is having trouble comparing them
4	FP	FP	TN	Tier2	Other assemblies agree something is there
3	TN	TN	FP	Tier2	No variants there until we get a second alignment
2	FP	FP	TP	Tier2	No variants there until we compare the alignments
7	TN	TN	TP	Tier2	Sensitive to phab 'resizing' variants
1	TP	TN	TN	Tier2	Don't like how it changes N/P state

1	FP	TP	FN	Tier2	All over the place
1	FN,FP	FN,FP	TP	Tier2	Both assemblies think its something different
1	FN,FP	FN	TP	Tier2	Variant there, first assembly made something else (possible collapsed het)
